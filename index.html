                <p>The main goal of the game is to shoot as many ducks as
                    possible, while spending as few rounds of ammunition.To
                    shoot you need to click the mouse on the screen, trying to hit
                    the duck. One game consists of 5 waves. On each
                    subsequent wave, the number of ducks and ammunition
                    increases. The speed of the duck also increases.
                    At the end of the game, the final statistics with the
                    percentage of accuracy appear.The best record will be
                    displayed in the menu depending on the level of difficulty.The
                    number of ducks is equal to the number of rounds.The wave
                    ends when the bullets or ducks run out.
